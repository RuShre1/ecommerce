E-Commerce Full Stack Application
Author: Rushina Shrestha

Project Overview
This is a full-stack e-commerce application built using React.js on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend. It integrates with MongoDB for storing product and user data and uses Stripe for payment processing.
